Overview:
This project is a GUI representation of the game of Chess. In chess two players 
attempt to strategically capture each other's king by first putting the King in check,
meaning that they are able to capture (move their piece to the spot where the King is on the 
board) in one more move, and then capturing the King. The pieces behave in he same manner as
they would in a real life chess game.
The basic game has a single platform setup, where two players can play using the same mouse, 
or one person can pla by them self. The bottom team always starts and the player can begin 
by choosing a piece to move and the square that is allowed, showed by highlighted spots. Play alternates
between the bottom and the top team. Players can change the view between 2d figures and 3d figures
using the "Settings" menu bar. Players can also chose between 9 different colors for the pieces of \
both teams.
The Chess game also supports network play. If you desire to play with someone on another 
computer the player can use the Multiplayer menu bar and chose either host or join. If the player
chooses to host their IP Address is displayed and they can give this to the player who selects join.
After the player who is joining types in the correct IP, a fresh Chess game will start and allow
the players to play wih one another. They have all the same settings options as in the single platform
setup and none of these options will affect the player that the are connected to.
If a user wants to quit or restart the game, these options are presented in the Quit/Restart.
